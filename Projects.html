    <h2>Atari 2600</h2>
    <h3>A Collection of simple games I have designed using 6502 Assembly Language</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Atari 2600 or Atari VCS was one of the first home video game consoles and has one of the longest video game console
      lifespans. I have always had an interest in games starting with the Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom at a young.
      Perhaps i have an even greater interest in making them always spending more time on the "Map Editor" than on the actual game.</p>
    <p>Some months ago I decided I wanted to go back to the past and explore how games were programed in the past. Today its easier than ever
      with IDE's such as Unity and the Unreal Engine. The Atari 2600 and many other computers and video game consoles of the Era uses
      the <strong> 6502 progressor</strong> which is coded in <strong>Aseembly Language</strong>. Below are a few simple games I have coded.</p>
